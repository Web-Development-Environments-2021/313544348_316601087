The functionality we added to the game:
•	The moving score character - the character we chose to add is a strawberry and it moves randomly on the board. When the Pacman eats it he gets an extra 50 points.
•	Clock - When the Pacman reaches it, the user gets an extra 10 seconds in the game.
•	Heart - When the Pacman reaches it, the user gets one more life in the game.
•	Candy - A candy that when the Pacman eats it, the user can lose a life in the game, or earn another life - both options are 50% likely to occur.
•	When the Pacman eats all the food on the board a suitable message is displayed.
